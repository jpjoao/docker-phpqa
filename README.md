# docker-phpqa

Docker tools to easily create and run tests for the PHP-SRC. The intent of this library is to help any PHP developer to
help PHP core developers by creating PHPT tests for the language engine and its core extensions.

## How to get it?

All you need to start using it is cloning the repository and have [docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) installed on your machine.

## How to use it?

1. Write a PHPT test and add it to the `phpt` folder;
2. Run the `./phpqa` command passing as arguments the filename and the PHP version to run the test (71, 70, 56, 55):
````bash
# without a version the test will run agains PHP 7.1 codebase
./phpqa phpt/examples/closure_061.phpt
# with a version the test will run against the specified version
./phpqa phpt/examples/closure_061.phpt 56
# if you want you can pass `all` as second argument and the test will run against all versions
./phpqa phpt/examples/closure_061.phpt all
````

Note that when running the test suit there will be an output message reminding you to run `make test`. THis is a standard message and you don't need to run it.
````bash
Build complete.
Don't forget to run 'make test'.
````

# TODO

* ~~Add more PHP versions (PHP 7.2alpha and PHP 5.5 at least) [Issue #5](https://github.com/herdphp/docker-phpqa/issues/5);~~
* Put some effort to shrink the images, either using the Alpine version of them or any other strategy [Issue #6](https://github.com/herdphp/docker-phpqa/issues/6);
* Integrate this repository with CircleCi in order to have the docker images builds tested [Issue #7](https://github.com/herdphp/docker-phpqa/issues/7);
* Improve documentation, adding a session about how to write PHPT [Issue #8](https://github.com/herdphp/docker-phpqa/issues/8);
